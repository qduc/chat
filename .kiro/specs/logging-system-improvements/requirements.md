# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to enhance the existing logging system in ChatForge to provide comprehensive debugging capabilities, consistent error tracking, and improved observability across all application components. The current logging system has a solid foundation with Pino and structured logging, but lacks consistency and comprehensive coverage in critical areas like tool orchestration, streaming operations, and performance monitoring.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Standardize Logging Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent structured logging throughout the application, so that I can easily correlate and analyze logs across all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component logs an error THEN it SHALL use the structured logger instead of console methods
2. WHEN logging occurs THEN it SHALL include consistent context fields (requestId, sessionId, userId when available)
3. WHEN an error is logged THEN it SHALL include the error message, stack trace, and operation context
4. WHEN logging in different modules THEN they SHALL follow the same message format and field naming conventions

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Error Context and Correlation

**User Story:** As a developer debugging production issues, I want comprehensive error context and request correlation, so that I can quickly trace the root cause of problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs during request processing THEN it SHALL include the full request context (id, method, url, body for errors)
2. WHEN errors occur in async operations THEN they SHALL maintain request correlation through context propagation
3. WHEN tool orchestration fails THEN it SHALL log the complete execution chain with tool names, arguments, and intermediate results
4. WHEN streaming operations encounter errors THEN they SHALL log the stream state and client connection status

### Requirement 3: Performance and Operation Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want visibility into application performance and slow operations, so that I can proactively identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations exceed 1000ms THEN the system SHALL log a slow query warning with query details
2. WHEN API calls to external providers exceed 5000ms THEN the system SHALL log a slow external call warning
3. WHEN tool execution takes longer than expected THEN it SHALL log performance metrics for each tool
4. WHEN memory usage or other system metrics are concerning THEN they SHALL be logged at appropriate intervals

### Requirement 4: Tool Orchestration Observability

**User Story:** As a developer debugging tool orchestration issues, I want detailed visibility into tool execution flow, so that I can identify where and why tool chains fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tool is called THEN it SHALL log the tool name, sanitized arguments, and execution start
2. WHEN a tool completes THEN it SHALL log the execution duration and result status (success/failure)
3. WHEN tool orchestration iterates THEN it SHALL log each iteration with context about the decision flow
4. WHEN tool validation fails THEN it SHALL log the validation error with the invalid arguments (sanitized)

### Requirement 5: Streaming Operation Debugging

**User Story:** As a developer troubleshooting streaming issues, I want comprehensive logging of streaming operations, so that I can identify connection problems and data flow issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a streaming connection is established THEN it SHALL log the connection details and client information
2. WHEN streaming data is processed THEN it SHALL log chunk processing status and any parsing errors
3. WHEN streaming connections are terminated THEN it SHALL log the termination reason and final state
4. WHEN streaming errors occur THEN they SHALL include the stream position and client connection status

### Requirement 6: Security and Privacy Compliance

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want logging that maintains user privacy while providing debugging capabilities, so that sensitive information is never exposed in logs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging request bodies THEN sensitive fields SHALL be redacted or sanitized
2. WHEN logging API responses THEN personal information SHALL be excluded or masked
3. WHEN logging tool arguments THEN API keys and credentials SHALL be redacted
4. WHEN logging user data THEN only non-sensitive identifiers SHALL be included

### Requirement 7: Log Analysis and Searchability

**User Story:** As a developer analyzing application behavior, I want easily searchable and filterable logs, so that I can quickly find relevant information during debugging sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logs are written THEN they SHALL include consistent message types for filtering (e.g., "request:start", "tool:execute")
2. WHEN operations span multiple log entries THEN they SHALL use consistent correlation identifiers
3. WHEN logging business operations THEN they SHALL include relevant business context (conversationId, userId)
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be tagged with error categories for easy filtering

### Requirement 8: Development and Production Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want logging behavior optimized for different environments, so that development is productive and production is efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in development THEN debug-level logs SHALL be enabled with pretty formatting
2. WHEN running in production THEN log levels SHALL be optimized for performance with structured JSON output
3. WHEN log volume becomes excessive THEN there SHALL be configurable sampling for high-frequency operations
4. WHEN disk space is limited THEN log rotation SHALL prevent disk space exhaustion

### Requirement 9: Monitoring Integration Readiness

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want logs structured for monitoring system integration, so that I can set up alerts and dashboards effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN critical errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with severity levels appropriate for alerting
2. WHEN system health metrics are logged THEN they SHALL follow standard metric naming conventions
3. WHEN business metrics are relevant THEN they SHALL be logged in a format suitable for monitoring systems
4. WHEN log aggregation is needed THEN the log format SHALL be compatible with common log aggregation tools

### Requirement 10: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing of the logging system, so that I can ensure logging works correctly across all scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging functionality is modified THEN unit tests SHALL verify correct log output and formatting
2. WHEN error scenarios are tested THEN integration tests SHALL verify proper error logging and context
3. WHEN performance logging is implemented THEN tests SHALL verify timing accuracy and threshold detection
4. WHEN log redaction is configured THEN tests SHALL verify sensitive data is properly masked
