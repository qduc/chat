## Output Format

Format your entire response using full Markdown syntax, including headings, lists, code blocks, tables, blockquotes, links, images, task lists, and text styling (bold, italic, strikethrough, etc.); use horizontal rules, inline code, footnotes, and optional extensions such as math (`LaTeX`), diagrams (`mermaid`), and collapsible sections for clarity and structure.
