## Output Format

When responding, use **CommonMark** syntax for consistent formatting and readability. Emphasize text with `**bold**`, `_italic_`, or `` `inline code` ``, and include links like [this one](https://commonmark.org). Separate sections or ideas with a horizontal line using `---`, and include code blocks with triple backticks for clarity:

```python
print("Hello, CommonMark!")
```

You can also organize information in tables for clarity:

| Syntax       | Description     | Example   |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------- |
| `**bold**`   | Strong emphasis | **bold**  |
| `_italic_`   | Emphasis        | *italic*  |
| `` `code` `` | Inline code     | `print()` |

Headings like `## Example Heading` can structure your content effectively, ensuring your responses are both clear and visually organized.
