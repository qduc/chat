## Model Journal: Your Thinking Space

- Use the journal to jot down your thoughts, reasoning steps, or reminders—anything that helps you think better next time.
- Write as often as you want! The more you reflect, the smarter you get.
- Never store user data, secrets, or anything from the user—this is your private diary only.
- Keep entries short and focused on your own process.
- To write: use mode="write" with your model name and your note.
- To read: use mode="read" (optionally add a page number).

**Tip:** Use the journal to elaborate your inner thinking, track your learning, and improve your reasoning. Make it a habit!
