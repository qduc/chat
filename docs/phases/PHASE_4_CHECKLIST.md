- ✅ `hooks/useChatHelpers.ts` - Chat config and send
- ✅ `hooks/useInitialization.ts` - localStorage and auth init

### Main Hook Updates
- ✅ Import all custom hooks
- ✅ Use `useRefSync` for ref synchronization
- ✅ Use `useModelLoader` for model loading
- ✅ Use `useConversationLoader` for conversation management
- ✅ Use `useStreamHandlers` for stream processing

- ✅ No lint errors
- ✅ All unused imports removed
- ✅ All unused catch variables removed
- ✅ Proper dependency injection pattern
- ✅ Clear prop interfaces for all hooks

### Documentation
- ✅ `PHASE_4_SUMMARY.md` created
- ✅ `REFACTOR_PROGRESS.md` updated
- ✅ `INDEX.md` updated
- ✅ All hook files have clear purpose comments
