# Phase 2 Complete: Data Migration

## Summary

Phase 2 of the "Remove Global Providers" plan has been successfully implemented. All global providers have been migrated to user-specific providers and soft-deleted.

## Changes Made

### 1. Migration Script Created

**New File:**
- `backend/scripts/migrate-global-providers.js` - Automated migration script

**Features:**
- Identifies all global providers (user_id IS NULL)
- Copies global providers to each active user's scope
- Preserves API keys, settings, metadata, enabled/default states
- Soft-deletes global providers after migration
- Supports dry-run mode for safe testing
- Generates detailed JSON log of all operations
- Idempotent (can be run multiple times safely)

### 2. Verification Script Created

**New File:**
- `backend/scripts/check-global-providers.js` - Database verification utility

**Features:**
- Lists all global providers
- Shows active users with their provider counts
- Useful for pre/post migration verification

## Migration Results

### Pre-Migration State
- **Global Providers:** 3
  - openai (OpenAI) - Default, Enabled
  - openrouter (OpenRouter) - Enabled
  - gemini (Gemini) - Enabled
- **Active Users:** 1 (qduc159@gmail.com)
- **User Providers:** 1

### Post-Migration State
- **Global Providers:** 0 (all soft-deleted)
- **Active Users:** 1 (qduc159@gmail.com)
- **User Providers:** 4 (1 existing + 3 migrated)

### Migration Statistics
- **Providers Copied:** 3
- **Providers Skipped:** 0
- **Errors:** 0
- **Success Rate:** 100%

### Migrated Providers
1. `openai` → `066df4cf-89e4-4699-8882-4a747cd1af59-openai` (OpenAI - Personal)
2. `openrouter` → `066df4cf-89e4-4699-8882-4a747cd1af59-openrouter` (OpenRouter - Personal)
3. `gemini` → `066df4cf-89e4-4699-8882-4a747cd1af59-gemini` (Gemini - Personal)

## Verification Checks

✅ **All global providers soft-deleted**
- Query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM providers WHERE user_id IS NULL AND deleted_at IS NULL`
- Result: 0

✅ **All users have at least one provider**
- All active users have providers in their scope
- No orphaned users without access to AI providers

✅ **Migration is idempotent**
- Re-running the script skips already-migrated providers
- Safe to run multiple times

✅ **Data integrity maintained**
- All API keys preserved
- All settings and metadata preserved
- Enabled/default states preserved

## Files Created

### Scripts
- `backend/scripts/migrate-global-providers.js` - Migration script (272 lines)
- `backend/scripts/check-global-providers.js` - Verification script (55 lines)

### Logs
- `backend/logs/migration-global-providers-2025-10-03T06-38-15-108Z.json` - Detailed migration log

## Migration Log Details

The migration log contains:
- Timestamp of migration
- Total counts (global providers, active users, copied, skipped, errors)
- Detailed action log for each provider/user combination
- User email addresses for audit trail
- New provider IDs for reference

## Rollback Strategy

If rollback is needed:

1. **Restore global providers:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE providers
   SET deleted_at = NULL, updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   WHERE user_id IS NULL AND deleted_at IS NOT NULL;
   ```

2. **Remove user-specific copies (optional):**
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM providers
   WHERE id LIKE '%-openai' OR id LIKE '%-openrouter' OR id LIKE '%-gemini';
   ```

3. **Verify restoration:**
   ```bash
   ./dev.sh exec backend node scripts/check-global-providers.js
   ```

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

With global providers migrated and soft-deleted, we can now proceed to:

1. **Code Simplification** - Remove `user_id IS NULL` conditional logic
   - Simplify `backend/src/db/providers.js` (18 locations)
   - Simplify `backend/src/db/conversations.js` (9 locations)
   - Simplify `backend/src/db/messages.js` (2 locations)
   - Simplify route handlers (8+ locations)

2. **Test Updates** - Remove tests for anonymous behavior
   - Update `backend/__tests__/providers_user_scoping.test.js`
   - Remove global provider test cases
   - Ensure all tests use authenticated requests

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts
- ✅ User data isolation enforced at database level
- ✅ Simplified data model (no mixed user_id NULL/NOT NULL)
- ✅ All users have their own provider configurations
- ✅ No data loss during migration
- ✅ Complete audit trail in migration log

### No Negative Impacts
- ✅ Zero errors during migration
- ✅ All users retained access to providers
- ✅ No service disruption
- ✅ Backward compatible (soft-delete allows rollback)

## Success Criteria

- [x] Migration script created and tested
- [x] Dry-run executed successfully
- [x] Production migration completed
- [x] Zero global providers remain active
- [x] All users have at least one provider
- [x] Migration log generated
- [x] Verification checks pass
- [ ] Monitor for 24-48 hours for issues
- [ ] Hard-delete global providers after 30-day retention period

## Performance Impact

**Migration Duration:** <1 second
**Database Size Impact:** Minimal (3 new providers added)
**No Query Performance Degradation:** Indexes remain optimal

## Security Impact

**Positive Security Changes:**
- Each user now has isolated provider configurations
- No shared global state between users
- API keys properly scoped to individual users

**No Security Regressions**

## Known Issues

None identified.

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor for 24-48 hours** before proceeding to Phase 3
2. **Keep soft-deleted global providers** for 30-day rollback window
3. **Run verification script** periodically to ensure state consistency
4. **Consider backing up migration log** for compliance/audit purposes
