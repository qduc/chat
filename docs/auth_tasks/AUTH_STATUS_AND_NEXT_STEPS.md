# Authentication Implementation: Current Status and Next Steps

## 📋 Project Overview

**What we're doing:** Adding user authentication to ChatForge, a modern chat application with Next.js frontend and Node.js backend. Currently, the app uses session-based data isolation, and we're adding proper user accounts while maintaining backward compatibility.

**Why:** Enable user-specific features like personal provider configurations, conversation persistence across devices, and enhanced security.

**Architecture:** The app already has session management (`cf_session_id` cookies) and database schema with `user_id` fields (currently NULL). We're building on this foundation rather than replacing it.

## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

- **3 Phases:** Core Auth → Enhanced Features → Advanced Features
- **Backward Compatible:** Existing anonymous users continue to work
- **Gradual Migration:** Anonymous sessions can be converted to user accounts
- **Session Preservation:** No data loss during transition

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### 1. ✅ COMPLETED: Phase 1.5: State Management Updates
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - Chat state management now includes full authentication integration
**What:** Updated chat state management to handle authentication and user context
**Priority:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ Updated `ChatState` interface with `user` and `isAuthenticated` fields
- ✅ Added authentication actions (`SET_USER`, `SET_AUTHENTICATED`) to `ChatAction` type
- ✅ Updated chat reducer to handle authentication state changes
- ✅ Integrated `useChatState` hook with `AuthContext` for automatic state synchronization
- ✅ Added `setUser` and `setAuthenticated` action methods to the hook
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite for authentication state management
- ✅ All authentication and chat state tests passing (20/20)
- ✅ Authentication state automatically syncs between AuthContext and chat state

### 2. Phase 2.1: Provider User Scoping (Next Priority)
**File:** `docs/auth_tasks/phase2-1-provider-user-scoping.md`
**What:** Implement user-scoped providers so authenticated users can have their own provider configurations
**Dependencies:** ✅ Phases 1.4 and 1.5 completed successfully - ready to proceed
**Time Estimate:** 5-7 hours

**Key Components Needed:**
- Database migration for user-scoped providers
- Update provider database operations for user ownership
- Modify provider API routes to handle user scoping
- Update frontend provider components for user-specific providers

## 📋 Phase 1 Critical Path (Must Complete in Order)

```
1.1 Database Schema → 1.2 Backend Auth → 1.3 API Security → 1.4 Frontend Auth → 1.5 State Management
```

**Why Sequential:** Each step builds on the previous one. Cannot parallelize Phase 1.

- **Main Plan:** `docs/USER_AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- **Task Breakdown:** `docs/auth_tasks/` (all individual task files)
- **Implementation Order:** `docs/auth_tasks/implementation-order.md`
- **Progress Checklist:** `docs/auth_tasks/checklist.md`

```

## ⚠️ Critical Requirements

### Environment Variables Needed
**Backend `.env`:**
```bash
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-minimum-32-chars
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=15m
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=7d
```

**Frontend `.env.local`:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:3001
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=ChatForge
```

### Dependencies to Install
**Backend:**
```bash
npm install bcryptjs jsonwebtoken express-rate-limit
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
npm install @types/jsonwebtoken
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

After each phase:
1. **Unit Tests:** Individual component/function testing
2. **Integration Tests:** API endpoint and database operation testing
3. **Manual Testing:** Login/logout flows, data persistence
4. **Backward Compatibility:** Ensure existing sessions still work

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Data Safety
- **Always backup database before migrations**
- **Test migrations on development data first**
- **Have rollback procedures ready**

### Service Continuity
- **Anonymous users must continue working throughout**
- **No breaking changes to existing APIs until Phase 1.3**
- **Session-based access preserved during transition**

## 📈 Success Criteria for Phase 1

- [x] Users can register new accounts
- [x] Users can login with email/password
- [x] JWT tokens are issued and validated
- [x] Existing anonymous sessions continue to work
- [x] Conversations are properly scoped to users
- [x] No data loss occurs
- [x] Performance overhead <200ms for auth operations

**Phase 1 Status: ✅ ALL CRITERIA MET**

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### For Each Task:
1. **Read the specific task file** (e.g., `phase1-1-database-schema.md`)
2. **Update the checklist** (`checklist.md`) as you progress
3. **Test thoroughly** before moving to next task
4. **Document any deviations** from the plan
5. **Commit changes** with clear commit messages

### Commands to Run Tests:
```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend && npm test

# Frontend tests
cd frontend && npm test

# Both (from root)
npm test
```

### Development Server:
```bash
# Start both services
./dev.sh up --build

# Frontend: http://localhost:3003 (dev container)
# Backend: http://localhost:4001 (dev container)
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Database Migration Fails
- Check database file permissions
- Verify migration syntax
- Run `./dev.sh migrate up` for container environment

### JWT Token Issues
- Ensure JWT_SECRET is properly set and long enough (32+ chars)
- Check token expiration settings
- Verify Authorization header format: `Bearer <token>`

### CORS Issues
- Verify backend CORS configuration includes credentials
- Check frontend API base URL configuration
- Ensure cookies are being sent with requests

## 📞 Getting Help

### If You Get Stuck:
1. **Check the specific task file** for detailed implementation guidance
2. **Review the main plan** (`USER_AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`) for context
3. **Look at existing codebase patterns** in similar files
4. **Test in isolation** before integrating with existing systems

### Key Codebase Patterns to Follow:
- Database operations in `backend/src/db/` files
- Route handlers in `backend/src/routes/` files
- React components in `frontend/components/` directories
- State management via React hooks in `frontend/hooks/`
