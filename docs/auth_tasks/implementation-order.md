# Authentication Implementation Order

## Overview
This document provides the recommended implementation order for the authentication system, including dependencies and parallel work opportunities.

## Week 1-2: Foundation (Phase 1)

### Day 1-2: Database Foundation
**Sequential Tasks:**
1. [Phase 1.1: Database Schema Updates](./phase1-1-database-schema.md)
   - Create users table migration
   - Update sessions table migration
   - Run migrations and verify schema

### Day 3-5: Backend Core
**Sequential Tasks:**
2. [Phase 1.2: Backend Authentication Layer](./phase1-2-backend-auth-layer.md)
   - Install dependencies
   - Create authentication middleware
   - Create user database operations
   - Create authentication routes

### Day 6-8: API Integration
**Sequential Tasks:**
3. [Phase 1.3: API Security Updates](./phase1-3-api-security-updates.md)
   - Update route protection
   - Update database queries for user scoping
   - Update API route handlers
   - Configure environment variables

### Day 9-12: Frontend Foundation
**Sequential Tasks:**
4. [Phase 1.4: Frontend Authentication Integration](./phase1-4-frontend-auth-integration.md)
   - Install dependencies
   - Create authentication context
   - Create token management
   - Create authentication components
   - Update API client

### Day 13-14: State Integration
**Sequential Tasks:**
5. [Phase 1.5: State Management Updates](./phase1-5-state-management-updates.md)
   - Update chat state interface
   - Update chat reducer
   - Update components for auth state
   - Handle auth state transitions

## Week 3: Enhanced Features (Phase 2)

### Parallel Development Streams:

**Stream A: Provider Scoping** (Day 1-4)
- [Phase 2.1: Provider User Scoping](./phase2-1-provider-user-scoping.md)

**Stream B: Data Migration** (Day 1-5)
- [Phase 2.2: Data Migration Strategy](./phase2-2-data-migration-strategy.md)

These can be developed in parallel as they have minimal dependencies on each other.

## Week 4-5: Advanced Features (Phase 3)

### Sequential Development:

**Week 4:**
- [Phase 3.1: Email Verification System](./phase3-1-email-verification.md)
  - Days 1-3: Email service and backend routes
  - Days 4-5: Frontend components and integration

**Week 5:**
- [Phase 3.2: Enhanced Security Features](./phase3-2-enhanced-security.md)
  - Days 1-2: Rate limiting and validation
  - Days 3-4: Security monitoring and session management
  - Day 5: Frontend security updates and testing

Phase 1.4 (Frontend Auth)

    Phase 3.2 (Enhanced Security)
```

## Parallel Work Opportunities

### Backend + Frontend Parallel Work
After Phase 1.3 is complete, frontend and backend work can proceed in parallel:
- Backend: Phase 2.1 (Provider Scoping)
- Frontend: Phase 1.4 + 1.5 (Auth Integration + State Management)

### Testing in Parallel
Throughout development:
- Unit tests can be written alongside feature development
- Integration tests after each phase completion
- E2E tests during Phase 2 development

## Critical Path
The critical path for basic authentication functionality:
1. Database Schema → Backend Auth → API Security → Frontend Auth → State Management

This represents the minimum viable authentication system (approximately 2-3 weeks).

## Risk Mitigation Timeline

### Week 1: Low Risk
- Database migrations are reversible
- Backend changes don't affect existing functionality until enabled

### Week 2: Medium Risk
- API changes may affect existing clients
- Frontend integration requires careful testing

### Week 3: High Risk
- Data migration affects all existing users
- Rollback procedures must be tested and ready

### Week 4-5: Medium Risk
- Email and security features are additive
- Can be deployed incrementally
