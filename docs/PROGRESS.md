# Progress Log

## 2025-08-13
### Done
- Scaffolded docs and repo
- Chose Next.js + Express
- Drafted API contract for /v1/chat/completions (streaming)
- Implemented backend proxy with streaming SSE passthrough
- Added rate limiting middleware (in-memory MVP)
- Bootstrapped Next.js frontend
- Implemented streaming chat UI (model select, stop, keyboard shortcuts)

## 2025-08-18
### Done
- Added explicit `dev` stages to `backend/Dockerfile` and `frontend/Dockerfile`
- Updated `docker-compose.dev.yml` to target the `dev` stages, use `/api` with `BACKEND_ORIGIN` for rewrites, and improve file watching
- Production builds remain unchanged; `docker-compose.yml` continues to use the prod image flow
- Dev containers now avoid pruning devDependencies and skip prod build steps for faster iteration

## 2025-08-24
### Done
- Added Responses API with conversation continuity support (`previous_response_id`)
- Implemented comprehensive testing infrastructure (Jest for both backend & frontend)
- Enhanced OpenAI request handling to support both Chat Completions and Responses APIs
- Added Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting (`react-markdown`, `rehype-highlight`)
- Integrated better SQLite support with `better-sqlite3`
- Added development tooling: ESLint, Prettier configuration
- Enhanced CI configuration with cache dependency paths for subprojects
- Created AI onboarding documentation for autonomous development
- Updated streaming support with proper SSE header flushing

## 2025-08-27
### Done
