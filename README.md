ChatForge is a full-stack AI chat application featuring a Next.js 15 frontend and Node.js backend. It acts as an OpenAI-compatible API proxy with enhanced capabilities including conversation persistence, server-side tool orchestration, and multi-provider support.

## Features

- **🤖 Server-Side Tool Orchestration** - Unified tool calling with iterative workflows, thinking support, and intelligent error handling
- **💬 Real-Time Streaming** - Server-Sent Events (SSE) with tool execution visibility and abort support
- **💾 Conversation Persistence** - SQLite-backed storage with automatic retention cleanup and migration system
- **🔌 Multi-Provider Support** - OpenAI-compatible interface with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini providers
- **🎨 Modern UI** - React 19 with markdown rendering, syntax highlighting, and responsive design
- **🗂️ Prompt Management** - Built-in and custom system prompts with conversation-aware selection
- **🐳 Docker Ready** - Development and production Docker configurations with hot reload support
- **🔐 Authentication & User Management** - JWT-based authentication with registration, login, and refresh tokens
- **👤 User-Scoped Multi-Tenancy** - Per-user provider configuration with isolated conversations and settings
- **🖼️ Image Upload & Vision Support** - Multimodal vision support with drag-and-drop UI
- **📎 File Attachment Support** - Text file upload with content extraction
- **🧠 Reasoning Controls** - Support for reasoning effort and extended thinking modes
- **💾 Prompt Caching Optimization** - Automatic cache breakpoints to reduce token costs
- **📓 Journal Tool** - Persistent memory tool for cross-conversation AI memory

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- OpenAI API key or compatible provider API key

## Quick Start

**Recommended: Docker Development**

```bash
# Copy environment files
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env and set OPENAI_API_KEY and JWT_SECRET

# Start with hot reload
./dev.sh up --build

# Follow logs
./dev.sh logs -f
```
